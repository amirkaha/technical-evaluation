1/ Ensure the data is is updated 20 minutes ago, it should state it was last updated 20 minutes prior to the current time checking / refreshing.
2/ Ensure that you need to type atleast 3 characters in the serach box. If I type less than 3, I should see the message "Please enter 3 or more characters".
3/ Type in a company that doesn't exist, I expect to see "No companies found" error message.
4/ Ensure that the keywords / acronyms of companies yield the same results of the companies full name. Eg. When I type BLD, I expect to see Boral, and vice versa.
